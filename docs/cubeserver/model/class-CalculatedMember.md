# CalculatedMember<a name="class-calculatedmember"></a>

Represents sophisticated computed members that are dynamically calculated using MDX expressions, enabling powerful analytical capabilities including complex business logic, mathematical computations, conditional calculations, and cross-dimensional analysis that extend far beyond the capabilities of standard dimensional members stored in database tables. CalculatedMember provides the foundation for advanced analytical modeling where business requirements necessitate dynamic member creation based on complex formulas, business rules, or computational logic that cannot be pre-calculated and stored in traditional dimensional tables.
