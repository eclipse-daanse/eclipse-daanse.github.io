# Translation<a name="class-translation"></a>

Provides comprehensive internationalization and localization support for OLAP metadata elements, enabling multi-language deployments where analytical content can be presented in different languages based on user preferences, regional requirements, or organizational policies. Translation represents a fundamental component of the OLAP globalization framework, supporting complex multinational enterprise scenarios where the same analytical model must serve users who speak different languages and operate within different cultural contexts.

      <td colspan="5"><em>Language identifier specified as a Windows LCID (Locale Identifier) that uniquely determines the target language and cultural context for this translation. The LCID encompasses both language and regional variations, enabling precise localization that accounts for cultural differences within the same language family, such as distinguishing between US English (1033), UK English (2057), Canadian French (3084), and France French (1036). This approach ensures that translations can address not only linguistic differences but also cultural formatting preferences, business terminology variations, and region-specific regulatory requirements. The LCID system supports comprehensive globalization scenarios including multinational corporations that operate in multiple regions with the same language but different business practices, regulatory environments that require specific terminology in official languages, and user experience customization where individuals can select their preferred cultural context even when working with the same underlying analytical data and business logic.</em></td>

The caption provides the primary user-visible text that represents the element in analytical tools, dimension browsers, measure lists, and other user-facing components of the OLAP system. This translation capability enables sophisticated multilingual user experiences where the same analytical model can present familiar, culturally appropriate terminology to users in different regions while maintaining consistent underlying business logic and data structures. Caption translations support complex business scenarios including global brand management where product names may vary by region, organizational terminology where department or role names reflect local business structures, financial reporting where account names must conform to local accounting standards, and customer-facing analytics where terminology must align with local market communication strategies.</em></td>

Descriptions enable rich multilingual metadata that goes beyond simple captions to provide detailed explanations of business concepts, calculation methodologies, data sources, and usage guidelines that help users understand and effectively utilize analytical resources. This descriptive translation capability is particularly valuable for complex analytical models where users need detailed explanations of sophisticated calculations, business rules, data quality considerations, and appropriate usage contexts. Localized descriptions support advanced user assistance scenarios including self-service analytics where users need detailed guidance to navigate complex dimensional models, regulatory compliance documentation where calculation methodologies must be explained in official languages, training and onboarding programs where new users need comprehensive explanations of analytical concepts, and administrative documentation where system operators need detailed metadata for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes.</em></td>
