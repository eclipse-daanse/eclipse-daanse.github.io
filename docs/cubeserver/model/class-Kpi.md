# Kpi<a name="class-kpi"></a>

Defines a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that provides sophisticated business performance monitoring capabilities by combining multiple analytical expressions with visual indicators, targets, and trend analysis to deliver executive-level business intelligence insights. KPI represents a high-level business monitoring construct that transforms raw analytical data into actionable business intelligence by evaluating performance against strategic goals, visualizing trends and status through graphical indicators, and providing contextual information that enables rapid decision-making at executive and management levels.
