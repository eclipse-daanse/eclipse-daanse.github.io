# Hierarchy<a name="class-hierarchy"></a>

Abstract base class for OLAP hierarchies that organize dimension members into structured levels, enabling multidimensional analysis through drill-down, roll-up, and slice-and-dice operations. Hierarchies serve as navigational pathways through dimension data, organizing members from most detailed (leaf) to most aggregated (all member) levels. They support both explicit level-based structures and parent-child self-referencing relationships.
